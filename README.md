# Task-list
### This project works similar to Google feature of adding events to the Google calendar. Or Apple's feature of adding events to calendar

This was my first experience with **react** library and "pre-interview task".<br><br>
Purpose of the project is to store today's events, that user add. It could have been a part of a bigger application.

I uploaded the latest version of this project on February 20th, 2020. However I finished it in 2018.
